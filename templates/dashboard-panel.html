        <p>This tool is designed to be used with The Chronicles System role playing game system.  Hopefully, I will be able to make it generic enough to work with other systems though.</p>
        <p>Below is a list of planned features:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Campaign Manager - this will give GMs a centralized location to store information about their campaigns such as NPC lists, story arcs, etc.</li>
        	<li>Player Character Manager - this will give players that ability to setup their character and share that will their GM.  Should be a great help in keeping track of PCs!</li>
        	<li>NPC Manager - this will come with pre-built NPCs for GMs to use and have the ability to add custom NPCs for later use.</li>
        </ul>
